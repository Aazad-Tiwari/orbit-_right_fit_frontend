## 🧠 Matching Logic

Each university’s data includes average GMAT, GPA, and experience.  
The backend calculates a **weighted fit score** based on how close a user’s profile is to these averages.

For example:
- If your GMAT is slightly below average but your GPA is strong, the score balances accordingly.  
- Results are ranked from **most compatible** to **least compatible**.

## 🧩 Data Source
